    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Hey there! My name is Mannan Samal but my family and friends call me <u>Aadi.</u></p>
    <p> I am 13 years old and my hobbies are reading, playing video games and solving rubix cube puzzles.</p>
    <p>I have many brothers and most of them are into coding and so I decided, why not follow this pattern and learn coding.</p>
    <h2><sup> Start</sup> Of My <sub>Coding Experience</sub></h2>
    <p>So with the help of my brothers, I began learning <i>C++, Javascript and HTML</i>. However I feel more comfortable with <i>HTML</i></p>
    <p>as it is a very simple coding language which can help me make websites and much more.</p>
    <p> Though I may not be the best at coding at my age, I still enjoy learning at anytime anywhere.<strong>(That's just me exaggerating!).</strong></p>
    <p> Being able to learn how to talk to computers sounds cool, but feels amazing! So you should try and see what you think about coding! Who knows, the change may be for the better! </p>
